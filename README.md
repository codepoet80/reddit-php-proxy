As of this writing, this works -- with the significant caveat that Reddit blocks you if this isn't run on a computer with an actual web browser that actually interacts with their website.

Fully headless proxying somehow gets detected and blocks you.

Future versions of this code may try sending the browser's cookies in the curl call, to make the proxy look more like a real user.
